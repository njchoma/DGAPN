# Spatial Graph Attention

This repository is the official implementation of Spatial Graph Attention Network (sGAT) within the paper "Spatial Graph Attention and Curiosity-driven Policy for Antiviral Drug Discovery". 


## Installation

### 1. Create conda environment
```bash
conda create -n sgat-env --file requirements.txt
conda activate sgat-env
```

### 2. Install learning library
- Pytorch **1.8**.0 (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- Pytorch Geometric **1.6**.3 (https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

  \* *make sure to install the right versions for your toolkit*


## Extension
